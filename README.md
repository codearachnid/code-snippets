# Code Snippets
A useful collection of simple snippets for functionality. Include raw language methods for PHP, JS, CSS, MySQL as well as frameworks that I use/used.

An unorganized collection of random code can be found in [my gists](https://gist.github.com/codearachnid) or [WordPress specific snippets](https://github.com/codearachnid/wordpress-snippits).
